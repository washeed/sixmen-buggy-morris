ai vs player six mens morris
This GitHub repository hosts an exciting project: an AI-powered Six Men's Morris game that pits players against an intelligent computer opponent. However, please be aware that the game is still a work in progress, as it currently contains several known bugs that have yet to be fixed.

The game offers a challenging and strategic experience, where players can test their skills against an AI algorithm designed to provide a formidable opponent. Six Men's Morris, also known as "MÃ¼hle" or "Nine Men's Morris," is a traditional board game with a rich history, and this project aims to bring it into the realm of artificial intelligence.

While the AI opponent poses a tough challenge, it's important to note that the current version of the game may exhibit unexpected behavior due to the existing bugs. The development team is actively working on addressing these issues and welcomes contributions from the community to help improve the game's stability and performance.
